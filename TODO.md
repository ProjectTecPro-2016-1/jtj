===================

### KNOWN BUGS:
- Jack can still walk through a 2 boxes gap.
- When Jack Jumps, if he tries to get up on a box, his jump will not be as high as it should, he will just lock on the top of the box, that is a bug and should be fixed.

### #7:
- Write game manual

### #14:
- When jack wins a level, move to the next (should have at least 3 here, but we could just do it for all the five levels insted).
- Make AI better so the probability of dropping a box in a column decreases when that column grid value is higher than the others(ATHOS handling it right now).
- Save High Scores in a file and load it when the game starts.

### #15:
- Help Menu (at least one option on initial screen which shows the basic commands and game rules?)

### #Extra:
- Add music to the levels (FURQUIM, for now, let's stick with your approach, I have a nice wav file for the levels, get it with me and add it to all the levels for now, what do you think?)
- When jack dies, the screen should freeze instead of just heading to the gameover screen, that's not friendly at all
- Not sure about this one, but I guess Jack could die when the boxes get a little closer to his head.
- Remove codes useless comments like unused code and stubs, also, remove Portuguese code!!!!
- Port to windows
- Port to Android
- Port to consoles like ps3, xbox and wii
