#13:
    Make boxes line disappear when complete.
    Player get 100 points when a line disappears.
    Victory condition (time inG or number of lines completed)

#14:
    When jack wins a level, move to the next (should have at least 3 here, but we could just do it for all the five levels insted).
    Make AI better so the probability of dropping a box in a column decreases when that column grid value is higher than the others.
    Save High Scores in a file and load it when the game starts.
    Game shall be installed with make install (/opt/jackTheJanitor)

#15:
    Help Menu (at least one option on initial screen which shows the basic commands and game rules?)

#Extra:
    When jack dies, the screen should freeze instead of just heading to the gameover screen, that's not friendly at all
    Decrease the falling boxes speed, maybe link that to the game difficulty?
    Not sure about this one, but I guess Jack could die when the boxes get a little close to his head.
    Jack can Still walk through a gap between two boxes without falling, we should fix that.
    When Jack Jumps, if he tries to get up on a box, his jump will not be as high as it should, he will just lock on the top of the box, that is a bug and should be fixed.
